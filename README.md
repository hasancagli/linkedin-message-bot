# linkedin-message-bot

In May 2020, I developed my first mobile application and I wanted to send my Linkedin contacts a message to let them know. 

I had a lot of contacts and if I send one-by-one, it would take so many time to finish it. 

After that I decided to create a bot that can message everyone with just one click. End of the day, I collected every connectâ€™s data and sent them the message that I want with my Linkedin Bot.

## To run the code

Please enter your linkedin profile's username and password to the "logininfo.py"
You can adjust the message you want to send from "new.py line 90"
Then, you can run the code with "python new.py"
